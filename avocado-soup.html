    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        My husband tried to tell me not to submit this recipe... he doesn't want the whole world to know about it, but I say share what you have! Serve with warm tortilla chips and a nice large mojito. Top with sour cream or creme fraiche if desired.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon olive oil
        </li>
        <li>
            1 large white onion, chopped, divided
        </li>
        <li>
            3 limes, juiced
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cup chopped cilantro, divided
        </li>
        <li>
            2 jalapeno peppers, halved and thinly sliced
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add chicken; boil until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 7 minutes. Drain.
            </li>
            <li>
                Run cool water over chicken to speed cooling process. Shred or finely slice chicken.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add 1/2 onion, lime juice, 1/2 cup cilantro, jalapeno peppers, and garlic until onion is slightly greenish in color, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine 4 cups water and bouillon powder in a small bowl. Pour into the pot. Let cook until just heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir chicken into the pot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ladle soup into 4 bowls. Top with remaining 1/2 onion, 1/2 cup cilantro, avocado, and queso fresco.
            </li>
        </ol>
